## 2FA Auth-Gen

This is a simple set of Python scripts designed to handle Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using the TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithm. It allows you to generate a secret key, create a scannable QR code for apps like Google Authenticator, and verify codes or run your own terminal-based authenticator.

### Core Features

* **Key Generation:** Creates a random Base32 secret key and a provisioning URI.
* **QR Code Support:** Automatically generates a `2FA.png` file so you can easily link the secret to a mobile app.
* **Verification:** A script to test if the codes generated by your app actually match the secret key.
* **Terminal Authenticator:** A live CLI tool that displays the current 6-digit code and a countdown timer for when it expires.

### Requirements

To run these scripts, you need Python installed along with two specific libraries mentioned in the generator script. You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pyotp qrcode
```

* **pyotp:** Handles the logic for generating and verifying the time-based tokens.
* **qrcode:** Handles the generation of the QR code image file.

### How to Use

1. **Generate a Secret:**
Run `2fa-auth-gen.py`. Enter your username and the name of the service (issuer). This will print your secret key and save a `2FA.png` file in your current folder.
2. **Add to Authenticator:**
Scan the generated QR code with any 2FA app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
3. **Verify Codes:**
Run `2fa-verif.py` and paste your secret key. It will let you input the 6-digit code from your app to check if it's valid.
4. **Terminal-Based View:**
If you don't want to use a phone, run `authenticator.py` and paste your secret key. It will display the active code and a progress bar directly in your terminal.
